# Algorithm-Check-Is-it-a-Tree-Graph
Directed graph and multiple edges are given as a single component. Determine whether the graph is a tree or not. In this case, it is required to determine if the graph is a cyclic graph (Contains Cycles) which contains a path from at least one node back to itself.
